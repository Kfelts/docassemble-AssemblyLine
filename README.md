# Document Assembly Line - Runtime Code

A jurisdiction-agnostic runtime package that supports rapidly automating forms
with a controlled style. Saves time over using just the base docassemble
platform.

This is the run-time code that supports the interviews at https://courtformsonline.org

This package supersedes [MAVirtualCourt](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-MAVirtualCourt).
